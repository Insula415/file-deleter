# file-deleter


This script will delete folders/file with one command and one directory.

If you want everything on your computer to go, simply put everything in one folder and run this command. 
This is very good if you want to delete documents quickly. 
There is no reviving the documents once this script has 
been executed. 

!!!!This was created on Linux so i don't know if it works on Windows or any other operating systems!!!!

Installation and more information in the "info.txt" file.

 - There are two python scripts in this repository:
If you want to manually type in the path of the folder you want to delete use the following files
codered, file.py, info.txt

If you want a desired folder to be deleted straight away use the following files
code-red, file2.py, info2.txt
