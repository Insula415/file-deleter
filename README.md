# file-deleter

If you want everything on your computer to go, simply put everything in one folder and run this command. 
This is very good if you want to delete documents quickly. 
There is no reviving the documents once this script has been executed. 


There are two folders, "codered" and "codered2"
Use files in "codered" if you want to manually type the directory you want to delete.
Use files in "codered2" if you want a certain folder to delete upon typing the command.

!!!!This was created on Linux so i don't know if it works on Windows or any other operating systems!!!!
