# file-deleter


This script will delete folders/file with one command and one directory.

If you want everything on your computer to go, simply put everything in one folder and run this command
This is very good if you want to delete documents quickly. 
There is no reviving the documents once this script has 
been executed. 

!!!!This was created on Linux so i don't know if it works on Windows or any other operating systems!!!!
