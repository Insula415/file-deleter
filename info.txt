HOW TO USE:
Read carefully or this won't work.
You can change the "codered" file to whatever you want, if you change it to "hello" when you type hello in the 
terminal it will run. So whatever you rename it to will be the word to run the script.

--------------------------------------------------------------
First, right click on the "codered" file and go to properties, then permissons.
Make sure the box what says "Allow this file to run as a program" is checked, otherwise the program cannot run.

Second, place the file called "codered" in /usr/bin/
To do this go into the current directory of codered and type the following command
$sudo cp codered /usr/bin/
if you are already root then no need for the sudo. If you have renamed the codered file then of course replace
the codered bit to your renamed file.

Third, make sure "file.py" is in your PATH environment variable.
To do this type the command 
$export PATH=$PATH:(directory of "file.py" e.g. /home/usr/Desktop/file.py)
If it works correctly then there will be no output.
If you need help, lookup how to add files to PATH environment variable.

That is it, enjoy :P

How does it work?

This is just a simple python script what uses the "shutil" library to delete folders/files.

Why can't the python script just be executed by itself?

It can but having the "codered" document just makes it easier to run. 
Instead of typing "python3 file.py" you can simply just type "codered" in any directory and the script will run.
