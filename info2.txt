HOW TO USE:
Read carefully or this won't work.
You can change the "codered" file to whatever you want, if you change it to "hello" when you type hello in the 
terminal it will run. So whatever you rename it to will be the word to run the script.

These are the instructions for the "file2.py" script, if you are looking to manually type the directory (aka file.py) please read the "info.txt" file.
--------------------------------------------------------------
First, right click on the "code-red" file and go to properties, then permissons.
Make sure the box what says "Allow this file to run as a program" is checked, otherwise the program cannot run.

Second, place the file called "code-red" in /usr/bin/
To do this go into the current directory of code and type the following command
$sudo cp code-red /usr/bin/
if you are already root then no need for the sudo. If you have renamed the code-red file then of course replace
the code-red bit to your renamed file.

Third, edit the "file2.py". Enter the path of the folder you want to delete 

Fourth, make sure "file2.py" is in your PATH environment variable.
To do this type the command 
$export PATH=$PATH:(directory of "file2.py" e.g. /home/usr/Desktop/file2.py)
If it works correctly then there will be no output.
If you need help, lookup how to add files to PATH environment variable.

That is it, enjoy :P

How does it work?

This is just a simple python script what uses the "shutil" library to delete folders/files.

Why can't the python script just be executed by itself?

It can but having the "codered" document just makes it easier to run. 
Instead of typing "python3 file2.py" you can simply just type "code-red" in any directory and the script will run.
